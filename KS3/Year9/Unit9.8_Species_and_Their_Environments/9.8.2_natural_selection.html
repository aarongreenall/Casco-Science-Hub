                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    You might hear someone dismiss an idea by saying, "it's just a theory." In everyday language, this means it's a guess or a hunch. In science, a **scientific theory** is the exact opposite. It is our highest level of understanding—a comprehensive, well-substantiated explanation for a wide range of facts, which has been repeatedly tested and confirmed through experiments and evidence.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">The Shift from "Law" to "Theory"</h4>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    In the past, scientists often called their biggest ideas "Laws," like **Newton's Law of Gravity**. The word "Law" suggested it was a final, unbreakable rule. However, science is always learning. While Newton's Law is incredibly accurate for most situations, precise measurements later showed it couldn't perfectly predict the orbit of the planet Mercury.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    Later, Albert Einstein developed the **Theory of General Relativity**, a more complete explanation for gravity that *did* perfectly predict Mercury's orbit. This doesn't mean Newton was "wrong"—his laws are so good that we still use them to plan space travel to Mars! But for technology that needs extreme precision, like GPS satellites, we *must* use Einstein's theory, or our navigation would be wrong by several kilometres every day.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    Because of this, scientists now prefer the word **Theory**. It's more honest and useful. It represents the best, most complete explanation we have, based on all the evidence, while acknowledging that it can be refined if new, measurable data comes along.
                </p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2">
                        This is why scientific theories are so powerful. The **Theory of Natural Selection**, like the **Theory of General Relativity**, has survived over 150 years of rigorous testing and agrees with all the evidence we have found. It is the bedrock of modern biology.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    **Natural selection** is the main process that drives evolution. It is the process where organisms that have inherited traits (due to genetic variation) that make them better suited to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass those advantageous traits on to their offspring.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 text-yellow-700 p-4 mt-6 mb-6 rounded-lg" role="alert">
                  <h4 class="font-bold">A Crucial Point: Generations, not Individuals</h4>
                  <p>Natural selection acts on **populations over many generations**. An individual organism cannot change its genes or "evolve" during its lifetime. An ape did not turn into a human; rather, over millions of years, tiny changes in the offspring of ape-like ancestors, one generation at a time, led to the evolution of humans.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    Before the Industrial Revolution in England, most peppered moths were a light, speckled colour, providing excellent camouflage against lichen-covered trees. A rare dark form existed but was easily spotted and eaten by birds. When factories released soot that blackened the trees, the roles reversed. The light moths became easy targets, while the dark moths were now camouflaged. The dark moths were more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes. Over generations, the dark form became the most common in industrial areas. The environment had "selected" for the dark trait.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    The theory can be broken down into four logical steps, using rabbits and foxes as an example:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Variation:</strong> Within a rabbit population, there is a range of inherited traits. Some rabbits are born slightly faster than others, or with fur that provides better camouflage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competition:</strong> Rabbits produce more offspring than can possibly survive, leading to a "struggle for existence." They compete for food and face pressure from predators like foxes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Survival of the Fittest:</strong> "Fittest" means best adapted. The faster rabbits or those with better camouflage are more likely to escape the foxes and survive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> The survivors reproduce, passing their advantageous genes (for speed or camouflage) to their offspring. Over many generations, these traits become more common in the population.</li>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    Evolution can be hard to see because it happens over such long timescales. However, in animals and plants with short lifespans and fast reproduction, we can see the outcomes of natural selection more clearly. Even minuscule changes in each generation can add up to significant differences over a period of recorded history.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4">
                    The Galápagos Islands provided a perfect natural laboratory for Charles Darwin. He observed that finches on different islands had distinctly different beak shapes. He realised each beak was perfectly adapted to the main food source on its island—strong beaks for cracking nuts, sharp beaks for eating insects. This was powerful evidence that the finches had evolved from a common ancestor, with each population adapting to its specific environment over many generations.
